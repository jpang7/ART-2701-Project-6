Final Project for ART 2701: A Game Powered on Ethereum (Ropsten Testnet)
---------------
Logistic information:

This is a small game about mixing resources at the right time in order to create new items. To get the "full experience" you would need a Metamask account (easiest to use as a Chrome extension: https://metamask.io/) so you can store your previous items. 

Your chances of making new items actually depend on which items you already own! We use the Ropsten net as persistent storage. Check out what you can win:

But even without an account there are 9 different items you can try to make. (The top 9 in red)


After getting an account, you should visit the faucet (free testnet ether) here https://faucet.metamask.io/.
