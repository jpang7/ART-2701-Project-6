Final Project for ART 2701: A Game Powered on Ethereum (Ropsten Testnet)
---------------
Logistic information:

This is a small game about mixing resources at the right time in order to create new items. To get the "full experience" you would need a Metamask account (easiest to use as a Chrome extension: https://metamask.io/) so you can store your previous items. We use the Ropsten testnet for persistent storage.

Check out what you can win:

*Your chances of making new items actually depend on which items you already own!* But even without an account there are 9 different items you can try to make. (The top 12 in red)


After getting an account, you should visit the faucet (free testnet ether) here https://faucet.metamask.io/.
