Final Project for ART 2701: A Game Powered on Ethereum (Ropsten Testnet)
---------------
Logistic information:

This is a small game about mixing resources at the right time in order to create new items. To get the "full experience" you would need a Metamask account (easiest to use as a Chrome extension: https://metamask.io/) so you can store your previous items. Your chances of making new items actually depend on which items you already own!

But even without an account there are 9 different items you can try to make.


After getting an account, you should visit the faucet (free testnet ether) here https://faucet.metamask.io/.
