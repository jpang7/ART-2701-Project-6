Final Project for ART 2701: A Game Powered on Ethereum (Ropsten Testnet)
---------------
Logistic information:

This is a small game about mixing resources in a timely fashion to create new items. **Your chances of making new items depend on which items you already own!** So to get the "full experience" that leverages the persistence of the blockchain, you should form a Metamask account (https://metamask.io/) so your winnings may be stored under your Metamask-generated wallet address. 

Pay for Ropsten fees with free testnet ether from a _faucet_: https://faucet.metamask.io/

Check out what you can win. Even without an account you can try to create the top 12 in red, but your earning history is within scope of your browser session:
