Final Project for ART 2701: A Game Powered on Ethereum (Ropsten Testnet)
---------------
This project is a small game about mixing resources to create new, collectible, and valuable items. **The character of your new item depends on which items you already own!** So to get the "full experience" that leverages the persistence of blockchain, you should form a Metamask account (https://metamask.io/) to store your game rewards under a wallet address.

Pay for Ropsten fees with free testnet ether from a _faucet_: https://faucet.metamask.io/

Check out what you can win. Even without an account you can try to create the top 12 in red, but keep in mind your earning history does not preserve beyond your browser session:
