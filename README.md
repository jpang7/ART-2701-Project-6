Final Project for ART 2701: A Game Powered on Ethereum (Ropsten Testnet)
---------------
Logistic information:

This is a game about mixing resources at the right time in order to create new items. To get the "full experience" you would need a Metamask account (easiest to use as a Chrome extension: https://metamask.io/) because your chances of getting certain items depend on which items you already own.


After getting an account, you should visit the faucet (free testnet ether) here https://faucet.metamask.io/. 


I will have an interface that lets you see your items up and even offer them for sale by Friday afternoon(?)
